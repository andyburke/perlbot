This plugin is very Not Done Yet.  Play w/ it at your own risk.

This is a good example of IPC, though... so please share anything you do
with it w/ perlbot@nimh.net...

The binary is built against a glibc2 linux elf x86 system... i'm looking
into getting the source code for our modded hal, and I think i'll prolly
forget to update this file... so if there's a dir in here called like, src,
you might wanna look at it...

if you don't know what you're doing here, just leave the noload for this
plugin in the config file...  If something goes wrong, you'll end up with
zombie processes and a poorly behaving bot.
