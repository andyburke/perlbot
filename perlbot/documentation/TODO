TODO:

for 2.0:

- make the bot quit gracefully and catch all the right signals
- load/reload config files
- let admins change user's passwords, hostmasks, etc. via irc
- output buffering
- add a robust help system, possibly using xml
- port plugins
- create a plugin that publishes our config via RPC::XML::Server
  so we can make a botnet
- move Note.pm into the Notes plugin
- flock the config file when reading/writing
- move config stuff into a Config object
- add character-counting to max-output functionality in case of
  very long lines (1 line = 80 chars?)

when we can:

- per-channel option to auto-rejoin when kicked
- write help files for all the plugins that are included in the base
  distribution.
- implement user-defined formats for things like logfile names and
  logfile entries.  could use % codes, like %y.%m.%d for
  year.mon.day .
- make the User package more robust...
  - users should have more info that other users with the
    appropriate flags should be able to access, ie:
    real name, last seen, last unidle, email addy, daytime phone,
    home phone, real address, etc... anything one can think of that
    would be useful
    -- these have been added, but we really need an entirely new
       user config file and format...
  - this info should be able to be set by each individual user with
    as much or as little info as desired... this means we need to
    both parse and save out a seperate user config file
- rewrite the define plugin to behave just like an infobot... or better yet,
  port infobot to a perlbot plugin... major props to anyone who does this

THOUGHTS:

- currently, users need to say '#help core ...' for help on the core stuff
  like part/join/note etc. (i.e. the stuff in PerlbotCore)  is this OK?
  perhaps PerlbotCore could become something else, like Base.  Also, it would
  be ideal to move all perlbot modules, plugins, etc. into a Perlbot::
  namespace.  I'm not sure if there's any required mapping between filenames
  and package names, so this might not be possible without a lot of directory
  rearranging and other hacking.
