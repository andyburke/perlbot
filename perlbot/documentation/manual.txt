======================================================

WARNING!: DO NOT RUN AS ROOT.  We have seen people around the net run
perlbot as root.  This is ill advised.  Although the perlbot core
*should* be fairly secure, we make no claims as to its actual level
of security.  In addition, every plugin you run is a potential security
risk.  Please do NOT run this as root.

NOTE: When we use an expression like <version> or <botnick>, that
means you should substitute your perlbot version or your bot's nick or
whatever is inside the angle brackets, WITHOUT the actual angle
brackets.  So perlbot-<version> would mean perlbot-1.2.0 if you're
running version 1.2.0 .

=======================================================================


1.0 Requirements
================

  - Net::IRC (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Net/)
    -> Make sure you check back there periodically for new versions.  This
       package is still sort of in development, and we're not afraid to
       make use of features in the newest version.  Bugfixes here are
       important too.
  - XML::Simple (http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/)
  - Plugins may have their own requirements, and we trust plugin authors
    to put that in their documentation.
  - Optional, but recommended:
      LWP::Simple
      Geo::Weather
      RPC::XML
      RPC::XML::Server
      RPC::XML::Client
      WWW::Babelfish
      HTTP::Daemon
      HTML::CalendarMonth
      HTML::TableExtract
      String::Approx
      Gtk


2.0 Installation
================

  For personal use, you should simply be able to expand the archive in
  your home directory:

    tar zxvf perlbot-<version>.tar.gz

  System-wide use isn't possible just yet, but we're working towards
  that in future versions.

  However, some work has been done to allow you to run multiple perlbots
  from a machine if you have root access.  If you create a 'perlbot' user
  whose home directory is '/home/perlbot', you can add new bots under that
  directory, for instance: '/home/perlbot/logbot' would contain a perlbot
  tree.  You can then copy the file 'perlbot.initscript' to
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/logbot and run 'chkconfig --add logbot' (for RedHat-based
  Linux distros only; make the symlinks by hand otherwise) to have the logbot
  start at boot.  You can also use this script to stop/start the bot
  manually by passing it the parameter 'start' or 'stop'.  This is currently
  experimental, and you probably shouldn't play with it unless you know what
  you're doing.  (it's also a pretty poor hack :)

2.0a Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
==============================

  Perlbot 2.0 is a significant revision of almost every aspect of the bot.
  As such, upgrading isn't trivial.  Perlbot 2.0 uses XML as the format for
  storing its config file.  This allows us much greater flexibility as
  developers and opens the door to all kinds of inter-bot communication.

  Under the miscscripts directory, you will find a script called: convertconfig
  It takes a perlbot 1.x config file as its argument and prints out an XML
  version of it. (With some caveats)

  Example:

    convertconfig config > config.xml

  Would convert the perlbot 1.x config in 'config' to XML and write it to
  'config.xml'.  This will bring over a great deal of the configuration
  you've done for your 1.x bot, hopefully saving you some time.

  **You still need to look over the generated XML and make some minor
  changes.**

  - Any channel flags you specified in your 1.x configuration will be gone.
    They should be respecified ala the instructions below.

  - Your plugindir specifications will almost certainly need to be corrected.

  - Pluginprefix will be gone, it has been unified with commandprefix.

3.0 Settings
============

  You should create and edit perlbot-<version>/config.xml to suit your
  needs. This file is XML and uses XML syntax.  The provided
  config-sample.xml should be a good place to start.

  3.1  bot
  --------

    This class holds settings that pertain to the bot itself, such as its
    IRC nick and directories for logfiles and plugins.  There must be only
    ONE bot object in your config file!

    nick
      - Specify a nick that the bot will try to use.

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot" />

    logdir
      - This sets the directory that the bot will use for logs,
        which defaults to "./logs" if it is not set.  A good
        way to set this up to keep logs independent of perlbot
        version is to set it to "../logs" or some other directory
        external to the perlbot tree.

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs" />

    plugindir
      - This sets the directories in which the bot will look
	for plugins. (You should almost definitely specify
        Plugins/Core and Plugins/Basic to get any useful
        action out of your perlbot)

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs>
            ...
            <plugindir>Plugins/Core</plugindir>
            <plugindir>Plugins/Basic</plugindir>
            <plugindir>Plugins/Misc</plugindir>
            ...
          </bot>

    noload
      - This tells the bot not to load certain plugins.

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs">
            ...
            <noload>Weather</noload>
            <noload>Seen</noload>
            ...
          </bot>

    admin
      - This specifies which users (See section 3.3) are to be
        considered bot administrators.  This gives them the power
        to control the bot.  You will most likely want to make
        at least yourself an admin.  Be careful who you make an
        admin.

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs">
            ...
            <admin>billy</admin>
            <admin>tommy</admin>
            ...
          </bot>

    nickappend
      - This specifies the character to append to the end of
	the bot's nick when it cannot obtain its specified
        nick. Defaults to '_'.

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs"
               nickappend="_">
            ...
            ...
          </bot>

    ircname
      - This sets the bot's ircname.  Some IRC networks require
        that all bots are identified as such in either their
        nick or ircname.  So putting "bot" somewhere in the
        ircname would be a good idea on these nets.  The default
        is "imabot".

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs"
               nickappend="_"
               ircname="imabot">
            ...
            ...
          </bot>

    commandprefix
      - This is a character that will preface all the bot's
        commands.  This has no default and must be set or the
        bot will respond without any kind of prefix.

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs"
               nickappend="_"
               ircname="imabot"
               commandprefix="!">
            ...
            ...
          </bot>


    crashlogdir
      - This is the directory to which crash logs will be written.
        When something goes wrong and the bot crashes unexpectedly,
	a perl stack trace will be dumped to "crashlog.txt" in this
        directory, along with the error message from the crash.
        If your bot crashes unexpectedly, email your crashlog.txt
        to perlbot@fdntech.com (see section 5.0).  The default is
        "." (the current directory, i.e. your perlbot directory).

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               logdir="../logs"
               nickappend="_"
               ircname="imabot"
               commandprefix="!"
               crashlogdir=".">
            ...
            ...
          </bot>

    localaddr
      - This will set the hostname to which Net::IRC will attempt
        to bind.  If you have multiple network interfaces in your
        computer, you should set this to the ip or hostname of the
        one you wish your bot to connect from.  It is safe in most
        cases to leave this option out.

        Example:

          <bot nick="perlbot"
               localaddr="tabr.fdntech.com">
            ...
            ...
          </bot>

  3.2  server
  -----------

    Each server object represents an IRC server that you want your perlbot
    to use.  You should specify several servers, so that if your bot loses
    its connection to one, it can roll over to another and stay on IRC.  You
    must have at least one server object or perlbot will print an error and
    refuse to start.

    address
      - This sets the address of the server, it can be an IP
        address or a domain name. (1.2.3.4 or irc.foo.com)

        Example:

          <server address="irc.fdntech.com" />

    port
      - This sets the port that the bot will try to connect to
        the server on.  The default is 6667.

        Example:

          <server address="irc.fdntech.com" port="6667" />

    password
      - This sets the server password if your server requires authentication.

        Example:

          <server address="irc.fdntech.com" port="6667" password="secret" />

  3.3  user
  ---------

    Each user object represents one person that you want your perlbot to
    recognize on IRC.

    name
      - This sets the unique name that the bot and other users
        will use to refer to that user.  It would ideally be
        the same as the user's usual IRC nick, perhaps without
        extra punctuation like trailing _ or ` characters.

        Example:

          <user name="billy" />

    hostmask
      - This sets a hostmask for the user, which is how they
	are recognized.  Be mindful of your users' hostmasks,
	they can easily allow the wrong person to access the
	bot as that user if not configured correctly.  There
	can be any number of these specified.  The bot may
        refuse to add certain hostmasks if they are deemed
        insecure.

        Example:

          <user name="billy">
            ...
            <hostmask>*!*billy@*.billy.com</hostmask>
            <hostmask>*!*billy@*.funtimes.com</hostmask>
            ...
          </user>

    password
      - Allows users to authenticate themselves when not
        connected via a hostmask specified in the config file.
        Look in miscscripts/ for the perlbotpasswd script to
        help you generate user passwords.

        Example:

          <user name="billy"
                password="lakLKJAS./ASD">
            <hostmask>*!*billy@*.billy.com</hostmask>
          </user>

  3.4  channel
  ------------

    name
      - The name of the channel.  If the leading # or & character
        is omitted, perlbot will assume # .

        Example:

          <channel name="#perlbot" />

    key
      - The channel key (only needed if the channel has a key).

        Example:

          <channel name="#perlbot"
                   key="secret" />

    flags
      - This sets the channel flags, such as +snt etc.

        Example:

          <channel name="#perlbot"
                   flags="-s+tn" />

    logging
      - Turns logging on or off for the channel.  Takes "yes" or
        "no" (which mean "logging on" and "logging off", respectively).
        The default is "no"!  If perlbot is not logging your channel,
        make sure logging is set to "yes".

        Example:

          <channel name="#perlbot"
                   flags="-s+tn"
                   logging="yes" />

    rolllogfile
      - Tells the bot how to store logs.  If this is set to 'no', then
        the file <logdir>/<channel>.log will be created.  If it is
        set to 'yes', then <logdir>/<channel>/<date> files will be
        created.  One log file will be created per day.

        Example:

          <channel name="#perlbot"
                   logging="yes"
                   rolllogfile="no" />

    op
      - This sets a user to be an op for the channel.  It expects
        the name field from their user object.

        Example:

          <channel name="#perlbot">
            <op>billy</op>
            <op>timmy</op>
          </channel>

    limit
      - This sets the maximum number of users in the channel.
        The default is 0 which means there is no limit.
        (this setting is not currently implemented/enforced)

        Example:

          <channel name="#perlbot"
                   limit="100" />

4.0 Using It
============

  4.1  What now?
  --------------

    So you have this shiny new perlbot, all configured, and you want to know
    what you can do with it.  The basic bot functionality already has online
    documentation.  Simply msg the bot "<commandprefix>help" and you'll get
    information on how to use the online help facility.

  4.2  How do I freakin' run this thing?
  --------------------------------------

    4.2.1  I'm the bot admin
    ------------------------

      The commands you'll most often use are probably join, and quit.
      They join channels and quit the bot, respectively.  Message the
      bot:

        <commandprefix>help

      for more information.

    4.2.2  I'm a user
    -----------------

      The commands you'll most often use are auth, password, addhost,
      and the note-related commands.  Message the bot:

        <commandprefix>help Authentication
  
      for more information.

    4.2.3  I need more help!
    ------------------------

      Check the FAQ included with perlbot.  If you still need more help, try
      posting to the forums at perlbot.sourceforge.net.


5.0 Debugging
=============

  If you have major problems, please set the environment variable
  PERLBOT_DEBUG to 1.  Then, run:

    ./perlbot.pl > pblog.txt

  Now make the problem occur again, and then email pblog.txt and
  crashlog.txt (see "crashlogdir" under section 3.1 above) to
  perlbot@fdntech.com .


6.0 Mailing List
================

  To subscribe to the perlbot mailing list, go to perlbot.sourceforge.net,
  click on the link to SourceForge, and go to the Mailing Lists area.
  There you can sign up for our various lists for developers, users,
  announcements of new versions, etc.
